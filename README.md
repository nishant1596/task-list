This is the crud application which does not involve update thing. Also it does not take descriptions. This is a very basic project to understand the "LocalStorage" in browser. This i useful for the applications where you don't want to login. It invloves Html, Css and Materialize-CSS framework. In later version, i will put an option to sync your data to database (firebase with Node.js)
